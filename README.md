# AdaptiveStagger_reproduce

Code to reproduce simulation results, tables, figures, and trial illustration from the paper "Bayesian Phase 1-2 Designs with Adaptive Rules for Staggering Patient Entry"

# Overview

-   The main functions are stored in the folder "**Sim_codes_functions**".

-   Specific codes to run simulations and combine results for each figure and table are provided in the corresponding subfolders. For example, the codes needed to reproduce Table 2 are located in the "Table2" folder.

-   Each folder containing more than one code file includes a README file that specifies the steps required to run the codes.

-   For codes designed to be run on a high-performance computing (HPC) cluster, we provide batch submission scripts compatible with clusters using LSF.
